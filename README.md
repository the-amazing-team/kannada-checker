# Kannada Checker

## Problem Statement and Motivation

Our project aims to address the challenge of determining and fulfil the extent of local or regional language usage on name boards of businesses and startups. By leveraging image processing techniques coupled with text extraction tools like EasyOCR and language detection libraries, the project seeks to calculate the percentage of local language content on these boards. This analysis serves to understand and encourage the use of regional languages in business representations, promoting inclusivity and cultural significance within communities .

## Installation

Before running the project, please ensure that you run the following commands to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will find that few sample images have been provided in the `dataset` folder. You can add your own images to this folder and run the project to see the results.

To compile and test the project on these samples, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will find the results in the `annotated` folder.

## Approach / Workflow

### Dataset

The dataset consists of 52 images collected randomly from Google Images. It has been ensured that the images are of high quality and are not blurred. Various images of all amount of text in both and Kannada and English have been included.

You can find the dataset in the `dataset` folder.
